# Technical Logistics of ArtStudio23.org?

## ArtStudio23.org (or artstudio23.org, or simply “website”) is a website that uses a simple structure, standard across almost all websites. 
## There are 4 major types of files on the website:
- ## HTML Files
- ## CSS Files
- ## JS Files
- ## Others (images, fonts, etc.)

# How Do You Know Which is Which?
### All these files can be hard to memorize and identify.
### However, there is a simple way to identify which file is which:
### Behind every file name, there is a .???, with the question marks being taken up by a string of seemingly non-sensical text, like .jpg, .jp2, .webp, .html, .js, or .css. These "file extensions" (formal name) identify which file is what type. 
### HTML files end with .html
### CSS files end with .css
### JS files end with .js
### Other files end with .ttf or .woff (fonts) or .jpg, .jp2, or .webp (and more, such as .svg), which are images.

# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
### An HTML file is basically the webpage. The HTML file holds the framework of the website. When changing text or images, you alter the HTML file.

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
### A CSS file holds the styling of a website. It is responsible for the look and the design of the website. 

# JS (JavaScript)
### JavaScipt script files are scripts that make the webpage interactive. 

## You can think of these files as a builing: HTML as the foundation and the skeleton, CSS as the furniture and decorations and more, and JavaScript as the "smart" things.

### All these things merge together to form a webpage. There is only one master CSS file, and a singular HTML file responsible for each page, with one master JS file.
